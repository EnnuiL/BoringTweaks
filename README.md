# Boring Tweaks

Boring Tweaks is a mod that has a small collection of toggleable and configurable tweaks. The only common theme between them is that they are all focused on the client-side. There are bug-fixing tweaks, behavior-changing tweaks and silly ones meant for amusement. This mod uses [Fiber](https://github.com/DaemonicLabs/fiber) and [Fiber2Cloth](https://github.com/shedaniel/FiberToCloth), therefore, the config system might be unstable and buggy. Due to the inclusion of [Cloth Config 2](https://github.com/shedaniel/ClothConfig), it needs [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to be installed.

## Usage

You can download this mod either by [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/boring-tweaks) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/joaoh1/BoringTweaks/releases). If you are willing to test the latest changes, you can obtain the dev builds through [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/joaoh1/BoringTweaks/packages), but it's not recommended and it is broken.
