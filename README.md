# Boring Tweaks

Boring Tweaks is a mod that has a collection of toggleable and configurable tweaks. The only common theme between them is that they are all focused on the client-side. There are bug-fixing tweaks, behavior-changing tweaks and silly ones meant for amusement. This mod requires the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and bundles the [Fiber Config API](https://github.com/DaemonicLabs/fiber) and [Cloth Config 2](https://github.com/shedaniel/ClothConfig) in order to provide configuration.
